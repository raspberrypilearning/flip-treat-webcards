## Introduction

In this project, you will create a set of flip cards with treats from around the world. The cards flip over when you hover over them or tap them. 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Flip cards**</span> add interactivity to a web page. They also allow you to provide additional information in a small space or hide information that shouldn't be immediately visible. Some common examples of animated flip cards are: revision cards, business cards, social media contact cards, and product cards. 
</p>

You will:
+ Use CSS animations to create a **card that flips over** when interacted with
+ Apply a **gradient** background using CSS
+ Add and use a font from **Google Fonts**
