<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Web designers**</span> need to consider how a website looks and how it reflects the brand of the company, product or person that they are designing for. Standard web safe fonts are recommended for the majority of text on a webpage but when a designer wants to create an impact, a more unique font can be used.
