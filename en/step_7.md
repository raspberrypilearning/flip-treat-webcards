+ Amend the colour gradient 
    + Choose new colours for `secondary` and `detail` variables to change the front card face
    + Choose new colours for `tertiary` and `detail2` variables to change the back card face
    + Change the gradient direction in the `gradient1` and `gradient2` classes (try `top` or `bottom left`)

+ Import a new fancy font to the `index.html` <head> tag and update the `--title-font` and `--body-font` classes.
