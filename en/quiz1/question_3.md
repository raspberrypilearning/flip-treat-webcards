You have found a fun font from Google fonts for a web page you are designing. To use the font in your project, would you need to update:

--- choices ---

- ( ) HTML

  --- feedback ---

  Not quite. You do need a `<link>` element to link to the font, but that's not all. 

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) CSS

  --- feedback ---

  Not quite. You do need to use the `font-family` property in your CSS, but that's not all. 

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) Both

  --- feedback ---

  That's correct. When you want to use a Google font in your project, you need to `<link>` to the font in the `<header>` of your HTML file. You also need to use the `font-family` property in your CSS to say which CSS elements should use the new font.
