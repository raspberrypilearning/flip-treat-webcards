 Which of the following is the best description of a **gradient**?

  --- feedback ---

  Not quite. A gradient is a kind of visual effect.

- (x) A gradual change between one colour and another

  --- feedback ---

  That's correct! A gradient is a gradual change between colours in a particular direction.

Not quite. You use a `border-radius` to create rounded corners, not a gradient.
